## BEFORE YOU BEGIN

This repository consists of most data structures and algorithms problems along with explanations and pedagogical knowledge to have a great understanding of them and build proper intuition. This repository is actively maintained and updated (Almost Daily).

**Here are some tips over how to use this repository**

* If you are a beginner to programming, a short introduction to c++/python will be helpful. DO NOT WORRY. I started as a complete beginner, not knowing how to write even a single line in c++.
* The Algorithms directory contains topic wise algorithms along with some great example problems.
* NOTICE that there is no separate directory for Data Structures, as most data structures are introduced while studying the algorithms. A short detour to hacker rank for studying applications of data structures can be taken, althought not necessary.
* After completely studying the Algorithms directory, you can move on to giving some programming contests(leetcode, codeforces, codechef) to build a daily programming practice.
    -> WHAT I DO: I make it a point to solve daily leetcode problems, give contests on all three websites, solve USACO training problems.
* USACO training blog is a really great blog for complete beginners who are aspiring to compete. (train.usaco.org)
* It has topic wise syllabus, along with problems related to them. The best thing about it is you only get to see the solution once you make a successfull submission. Therefore, there is no place to turn to except your own brain, when you are stuck at a problem. Doing this is what actually builds your intuition. Otherwise, looking at someone else's solution is like letting someone else do the thinking for you.

Have fun! ;)
