### Priority Queue

Priority Queue is an abstract data type that is similar to a queue, and every element has some priority value associated with it. The priority of the elements in a priority queue determines the order in which elements are served (i.e., the order in which they are removed). If in any case the elements have same priority, they are served as per their ordering in the queue.

##### Properties of Priority Queue
So, a priority Queue is an extension of the queue with the following properties. 

* Every item has a priority associated with it.
* An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
* If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

##### How to Implement Priority Queue? 
Priority queue can be implemented using the following data structures: 

* Arrays
* Linked list
* Heap data structure
* Binary search tree
