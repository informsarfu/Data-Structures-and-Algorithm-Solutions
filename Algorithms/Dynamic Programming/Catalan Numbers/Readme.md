# Catalan Numbers

Catalan Numbers is a sequence of numbers that appear in many counting problems in Combinatorics. They count certain types of lattice paths, permutations, binary trees, and many other combinatorial objects. They satisfy a fundamental recurrence relation and fit perfectly under the realm of Dynamic Programming. 

The first few Catalan Numbers are: 
C0 = 1
C1 = 1
C2 = 2
C3 = 5
C4 = 14
C5 = 42
